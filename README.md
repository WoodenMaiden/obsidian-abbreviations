# Obsidian Abbreviations Plugin

This plugin allows you to define abbreviations for words that will be expanded when you type them. This is useful for words that you often misspell or for words that you want to expand into longer words or sentences.



You can define abbreviations into the dedicated section in the menu, you can create, enable, disable, delete and even set them to be case insensitive meaning that even with all caps, an abbreviation can be expanded.
